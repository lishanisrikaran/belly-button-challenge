# belly-button-challenge

In this assignment, an interactive dashboard is built to explore a [Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset](https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json) which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

[Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard Breakdown](https://lishanisrikaran.github.io/belly-button-challenge/):
<li> A horizontal bar chart - displays the top 10 OTUs and their sample values which were found in the selected subject ID from the dropdown menu</li>
<li> A bubble chart - displays all the otu id's and their sample values of the selected subject ID from the dropdown menu</li>
<li> Demographic info tile - shows meta data about the selected subject ID from the dropdown menu</li>
